'''
Sometimes, we may wish to break a sentence into a list of words.

In such cases, we may first want to clean up the string and remove all the punctuation marks. Here is an example of how it is done.
'''

# define punctuation
punctuations = '''!()-[]{};:'"\,<>./?@#$%^&*_~'''

my_str = "Hello!!!, he said ---and went."

# To take input from the user
# my_str = input("Enter a string: ")

# remove punctuation from the string
no_punct = ""
for char in my_str:
   if char not in punctuations:
       no_punct = no_punct + char

# display the unpunctuated string
print(no_punct)
