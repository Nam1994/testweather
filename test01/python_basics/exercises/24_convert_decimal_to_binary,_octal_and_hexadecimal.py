'''
The decimal system is the most widely used number system.

However, computers only understand binary. Binary, octal and hexadecimal number systems are closely related, and we may require to convert decimal into these systems.

The decimal system is base 10 (ten symbols, 0-9, are used to represent a number) and similarly, binary is base 2, octal is base 8 and hexadecimal is base 16.

A number with the prefix 0b is considered binary, 0o is considered octal and 0x as hexadecimal. For example:

60 = 0b11100 = 0o74 = 0x3c

# Python program to convert decimal into other number systems
dec = 344

print("The decimal value of", dec, "is:")
print(bin(dec), "in binary.")
print(oct(dec), "in octal.")
print(hex(dec), "in hexadecimal.")
