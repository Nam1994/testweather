We use this method when the Id attribute for the element is available.
It is in fact, the most reliable and the fastest way to locate a particular web element on an HTML page.
An Id will always be unique for any object on a web page.
So, we should prefer using Id attribute for locating the elements over other available options.

Here is the code snippet that demonstrates the use of the <find_element_by_id> method.
Below code opens Google in the browser and performs a text search.
If more than one web elements have the same value of id, attribute, this method will return the first element for which the id matches.
It will raise a NoSuchElementException if there is no match.
